# Codecademy_Projects
The breakdown of code used for Projects with CodeCademy. The project title is Jeopardy. 
Instructions
- You will work to write several functions that investigate a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers. Filter the dataset for topics that youâ€™re interested in,      compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next Jeopardy champion!
- Write a function that filters the dataset for questions that contains all of the words in a list of words.
- Test your function by printing out the column containing the question of each row of the dataset.
- Test your original function with a few different sets of words to try to find some ways your function breaks. Edit your function so it is more robust.
- Make sure to use the dataset that contains the float values as the dataset you use in your filtering function.
- Write a function that returns the count of the unique answers to all of the questions in a dataset.
- Investigate the ways in which questions change over time by filtering by the date. How many questions from the 90s use the word "Computer" compared to questions      from the 2000s?
- Is there a connection between the round and the category? Are you more likely to find certain categories, like "Literature" in Single Jeopardy or Double Jeopardy?
